# go-opensea

This is a Golang library for [OpenSea APIs](https://docs.opensea.io/reference).

## Get Started

Execute the command below to download the library.

```
go get github.com/gsmachado/go-opensea
```

Instantiate an Opensea instance and then call one of its provided methods to interact with the Opensea API.

```go
func getAssetContract() {
    o, err := NewOpensea(os.Getenv("API_KEY"))
    if err != nil {
         panic("could not instantiate Opensea instance")
    }
    singleContract, err := o.GetSingleContract("0xdceaf1652a131f32a821468dc03a92df0edd86ea")
    if err != nil {
        panic("could not get asset contract")
    }
    fmt.Println(singleContract)
}
```
